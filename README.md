# CHIP-8 emulator
---

Based on the original CHIP-8 instruction set.
I used the wikipedia page [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) and this guide [Awesome CHIP-8](https://chip-8.github.io/links/).
I intend to build on this project or start something similar when I get time again.

This is currently untested / unfinished as other personal and work projects become too time consuming.

**Use at your own risk. No licence.** Blah blah blah...
